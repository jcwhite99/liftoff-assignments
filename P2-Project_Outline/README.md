## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a billing/invoice system specifically targeted to independent business owners.  It will be an easy way to keep track of work done with different companies and an option to send out an invoice on the same day every month with a convenient pay now feature.  I got the idea for this project because of my father in law.  He is an independent web developer and has a hard time collecting payments from his clients.  I feel that if it were easier to submit payment his clients might pay on time.   

### Features
Signup - general signup page - I want to learn how to unmask passwords and incorporate it here  
User login - general user login - again I want to use the password unmasking   
Company info - a page that allows the user to add or remove  a company name and an email link (the email link will be used to automatically send the invoice to the company on a predetermined date set by the user 
Services info - a page that allows the user to add and remove different services and prices  
Invoice page - a page that allows the user to see exaxtly what the customer is being billed for.  This invoice is what will be emailed to the company
* I want the company info, services info and invoice to be on the same page split into three sections.  I believe it will make this priogram easier to use with everything laid out on one page.  If the user chooses to add or remove a company name or a service they will be redirected to a page for that purpose.  
 Company Email - Invoice that is sent by the user with a pay now feature that will allow the company to input their payment information to make paying more convenient
