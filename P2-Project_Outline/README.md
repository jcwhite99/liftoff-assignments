## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a billing/invoice system specifically targeted to independent business owners.  It will be an easy way to keep track of work done with different companies and an option to send out an invoice on the same day every month with a convenient pay now feature.  I got the idea for this project because of my father in law.  He is an independent web developer and has a hard time collecting payments from his clients.  I feel that if it were easier to submit payment his clients might pay on time.
